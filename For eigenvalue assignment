n=2; %size of square matrices
N=100; %100 examples
x=zeros(1,N); %initialize vector to store data
for k=1:N
A=rand(n,n); %create a random nxn matrix
lambda=eig(A); %compute the eigenvalues of A
x(1,k)=isreal(lambda); %enter 1 in x if all eigenvalues are real, 0 otherwise
endfor
s=sum(x(:)==1); %count the number of times the eigenvalues were real
y=[s,N-s]; %data with number of times real, number not
pie(y)

%this creates a pie chart showing the number of times out of 100 the matrices had real eigenvalues. We can vary the n to get varying sizes of matrices and we see that as n increases the number of matrices that do not have real eigenvalues increase.
